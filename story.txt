There once was a young strapping lad who loved adventure, and         
resided in the countryside of Italy.

In his small town in Italy, people were always in need of somebody to go
on an adventure for them. This could be traveling through the woods to get a 
ingredient for days soup,  to fighting off animals eating the crops.
One day, an elder in the village asked for a meeting.

"Folks," announced the elder, "some of you may have known, that a herd of 
orcs have been wandering around our village and several other towns in the
vicinity. So, before finally deciding whether to expel them, I want to 
have  at least a little bit comminucation with them. Who would like to 
accompany me?"

"I would!" said the lad. So, the boy along with the elder and a few other brave soilders ventured out.
They tried everything but kept having to retreat from their battle with the orcs. They decided
to sit down and strategize. Then suddenly a mystical creature called Corona graced them.

"I can help defeat the orcs!" he said.
